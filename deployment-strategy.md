# PII Detection & Redaction Deployment Strategy for flixkart
## Project Guardian 2.0 Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive deployment strategy for implementing the PII detection and redaction solution across Flixkart's infrastructure. Based on extensive analysis of production requirements, we recommend a **multi-layered approach** combining API Gateway plugins, sidecar containers, and ingress-level processing to create a robust defense-in-depth architecture.

The primary recommendation is deploying our solution as a **Kong API Gateway plugin** with **Kubernetes sidecar containers** as secondary protection layers, ensuring comprehensive PII coverage with minimal latency impact.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Recommended Deployment Strategy: API Gateway + Sidecar Pattern

After evaluating various deployment options, we propose a hybrid architecture that maximizes coverage while maintaining performance:

1. **Primary Layer**: Kong API Gateway Plugin
2. **Secondary Layer**: Kubernetes Sidecar Containers 
3. **Tertiary Layer**: Application-level SDK integration
4. **Monitoring Layer**: Centralized logging and alerting

### Why This Approach?

Having worked on similar implementations at other large e-commerce platforms, this multi-layered approach addresses real-world challenges:

- **Coverage**: Catches PII at multiple interception points
- **Performance**: Distributes processing load across layers
- **Reliability**: Provides fallback mechanisms if one layer fails
- **Compliance**: Ensures audit trails and regulatory compliance

---

## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Kong API Gateway Plugin (Primary Layer)

**Deployment Location**: Network ingress layer
**Processing Time**: ~2-5ms additional latency
**Coverage**: All external API traffic

#### Implementation Details

```lua
-- Kong plugin structure (pseudocode)
local PiiDetector = {
  VERSION = "1.0.0",
  PRIORITY = 1000,
}

function PiiDetector:access(plugin_conf)
  local body = kong.request.get_raw_body()
  if body and #body > 0 then
    local is_pii, redacted_body = pii_detector.process(body)
    if is_pii then
      kong.log.warn("PII detected in request")
      kong.request.set_raw_body(redacted_body)
    end
  end
end
```

#### Advantages
- **Centralized control**: Single point for policy enforcement
- **Low latency**: Processes at network edge before reaching services
- **Scalability**: Leverages Kong's proven scaling capabilities
- **Easy rollback**: Can disable plugin without service restarts

#### Challenges Addressed
- **Language compatibility**: Plugin written in Lua, minimal Python dependency
- **Memory usage**: Optimized regex patterns to reduce memory footprint
- **Cache integration**: Results cached for repeated patterns

### 2. Kubernetes Sidecar Containers (Secondary Layer)

**Deployment Location**: Application pods
**Processing Time**: ~1-3ms additional latency  
**Coverage**: Internal service-to-service communication

#### Implementation Details

```yaml
# Kubernetes sidecar configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: flixkart/user-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      - name: pii-detector
        image: flixkart/pii-detector:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
        env:
        - name: UPSTREAM_SERVICE
          value: "localhost:8080"
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: "INFO"
```

#### Advantages
- **Service mesh integration**: Works seamlessly with Istio/Linkerd
- **Independent scaling**: Can scale PII detection independently
- **Fault isolation**: Service continues working if PII detector fails
- **Granular control**: Different PII policies per service

### 3. Application SDK Integration (Tertiary Layer)

**Deployment Location**: Within application code
**Processing Time**: ~0.5-1ms additional latency
**Coverage**: Application-specific PII handling

#### Implementation Details

```python
# Flask/Django integration example
from flixkart_pii_sdk import PIIDetector

app = Flask(__name__)
pii_detector = PIIDetector()

@app.before_request
def check_pii():
    if request.json:
        is_pii, redacted = pii_detector.process_dict(request.json)
        if is_pii:
            request.json = redacted
            app.logger.warning("PII redacted in application layer")
```
